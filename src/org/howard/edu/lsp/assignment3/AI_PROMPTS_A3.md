# AI Usage for Assignment 3

I used a generative AI assistant (ChatGPT) to brainstorm and refine my Assignment 3 design.  
Below are some of the prompts I asked and excerpts of responses I considered.



### Prompt 1
> “How can I redesign my single-class Java ETL pipeline into an object-oriented design with multiple classes?”

**AI Response Excerpt:**
> “Split your code into a `CSVExtractor` to read data, a `Transformer` to apply changes, a `CSVLoader` to write the output, and a `Product` class to represent each row…”

**How I Used It:**
I created those classes but adapted the names and methods to match the assignment requirements.



### Prompt 2
> “Show me an example Java class with Javadoc comments for public methods.”

**AI Response Excerpt:**
> “Use `/** … */` before your class and methods, including @param and @return tags…”

**How I Used It:**
I wrote my own Javadocs for each class based on this pattern.



### Prompt 3
> “How do I structure my project so Assignment 3 sits alongside Assignment 1 and 2 in the same repo?”

**AI Response Excerpt:**
> “Create a new package `org.howard.edu.lsp.assignment3` with its own classes, plus a `doc` subfolder for your reflection and AI prompts…”

**How I Used It:**
I created the `assignment3` package and `doc` folder as described.
